Hi, I’m Federico Moyá, a passionate software engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack web development, cloud infrastructure, and security. I specialize in building and scaling high-performance applications, particularly in SaaS environments, and I have extensive experience working with technologies like Ruby on Rails, React, Typescript, Node.js, AWS, Docker, and PostgreSQL.

Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to contribute to innovative projects, including the development of Qlty’s cloud-based static analysis platform, where I played a key role in product development, infrastructure automation, and security improvements. I’ve also worked on Codeclimate’s suite of quality tools and had the chance to impact the engineering community through open-source contributions to projects like simplecov and codeclimate’s CLI.

I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from Universidad Catolica del Uruguay and a Certificate of Proficiency in English from the University of Michigan. When I’m not coding, I enjoy solving complex technical challenges, optimizing workflows, and helping teams adopt best practices in DevOps and continuous delivery.
